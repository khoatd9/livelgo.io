# Livel Project - [Top 50 Google Solution Challenge 2021](https://oisp.hcmut.edu.vn/cuoc-song-sinh-vien/hoc-thuat-nghien-cuu-khoa-hoc/sv-bach-khoa-lot-vao-top-50-google-solution-challenge-2021.html)

A short summary of the Livel web project (UX/UI case study & prototype).

## Project overview
Livel is a mobile-first product concept built as part of the Solution Challenge 2021. It provides an online touring experience that allows tourists to book and join online tours hosted by licensed local guides. The project aims to help the tourism industry recover and adapt in a post-COVID world while promoting sustainable tourism.

## Demo
- Demo video: embedded YouTube link included in `index.html` (YouTube ID: 7OE8eJWqM7Q).
- Prototype and UI were created in Figma (wireframes and final screens).

## Problem statement
Travel and tourism saw a dramatic decline during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tour companies and local guides struggled to connect with customers due to travel restrictions. Livel proposes a way to expand the tourism market and preserve local guides’ work by offering online and remote tour experiences.

## Solution / Features
- Bookable online tours led by licensed local tour guides.
- Smooth, easy-to-use mobile UI with emphasis on discoverability and visual design.
- Features considered: image upload, gallery behavior, trip tags/keywords, review section, cancellation options, multi-image uploads.

## Target users
- Smartphone users aged 18–40 (frequent mobile users, stable income).
- Licensed tour guides offering tours on the platform.

## Author role
- UX / UI: information architecture, user flows, wireframes, and interface design.

## Design process
- Based on Design Thinking (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test).
- Research included quantitative & qualitative surveys and user personas.
- Prototype/testing done with Figma.

## Files of interest
- `index.html` — main static HTML page (project landing / case study).
- `tailwind.css` — project CSS (referenced in index.html).
- `index.js` — project JavaScript (referenced in index.html).
- `img/` — folder containing images/screens used by the page.

## Deployment notes
- If you host this via GitHub Pages:
  - For a project site (username.github.io/repo) the relative paths work as-is.
  - If you change your GitHub username, the project Pages URL that contains the username will change; relative asset paths remain valid.
  - Update any absolute links that include the old username.

## Contributing
- Open an issue or submit a pull request with suggested improvements (design, accessibility, responsiveness, content updates).

## License
- Add a LICENSE file if you want to specify licensing (e.g., MIT).
